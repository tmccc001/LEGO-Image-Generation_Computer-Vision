# LEGO Image Generator

## Overview
This project builds a LEGO-style image generation system that converts real-world pictures into mosaics made of LEGO bricks.  

This project included:
- Capturing images via camera
- Converting them into LEGO mosaics with limited colors
- Extending to multiple brick sizes and colors
- Deploying and testing in a real-world scenario

---

## Features
- **Task 1:** Capture and display images from webcam  
- **Task 2:** Convert captured image into LEGO mosaic using 1x1 bricks and 3 grayscale colors (white, gray, black), max 100x100 size  
- **Task 3:** Extend to multiple brick sizes (1x1, 1x2, 2x4, etc.) and 12 colors, with brick summary report  
- **Task 4:** Real-time camera input → generate LEGO-style mosaic frame on demand (press `b`)
